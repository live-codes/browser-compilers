Directory for custom Tcl code
=============================

This directory is turned into a .data file during the build process and loaded 
at startup together with (in parallel to) the wacl-library.data file. Both
of these data files are mounted to /usr/lib on startup and are put on the 
$auto_path of Wacl.

You can put your own packages and tcl code here in this directory. It will be
available in Wacl on the auto_path, i.e. if the directories here contain 
a pkgIndex.tcl file with the usual signature (see the Tcl documentation for 
the pkg_mkIndex command), you can load them with [package require ...] inside
Wacl.

It is not necessary to completely build Wacl when your Tcl packages change.
In order to update the contents of wacl-custom.data, you just need to put
your updated Tcl packages here and then run

python $(EMSCRIPTEN)/tools/file_packager.py wacl-custom.data --preload custom@/usr/lib/ >

(you need python and the emscripten SDK on your PATH, though).
